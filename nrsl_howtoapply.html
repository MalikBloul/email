    <p><strong><u>How to Apply</u></strong></p>
    <p>As a non-recent school leaver, entry into the {course_name} is based on your selection rank which is made up of
        any or all of the following:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Tertiary studies (including your GPA or WAM)&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Secondary studies (e.g., ATAR or equivalent)&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/study/high-school-students/getting-into-university/adjustment-factors"
                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adjustment Factor Points</a>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Post-secondary studies (e.g., TAFE &ndash; Certificate IV or higher)&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will need to provide your final secondary school marks and any other studies you have completed as part of
        your application. These will be used to determine whether you meet the requirements for entry into your
        preferred degree at Macquarie. The Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) will then generate a selection rank
        based on these results, which Macquarie will use to assess your application. The selection rank for the
        {course_name} is {selection_rank}.</p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that the higher your previous tertiary marks are, the more competitive your application is
        likely to be.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Applications for undergraduate study should be made through <a href="https://www.uac.edu.au/" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">UAC</a>, using the code {uac_code}. {key_dates} Applications are assessed on a rolling basis and application dates can be found on
