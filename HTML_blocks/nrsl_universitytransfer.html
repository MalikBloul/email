    <p><strong><u>Transferring to Macquarie University</u></strong></p>
    <p>To transfer to Macquarie University, you will need to apply via <a href="https://www.uac.edu.au/" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">UAC</a> and provide your current tertiary marks, your final secondary school
        marks, and any other studies you have completed. These will be used to determine whether you meet the
        requirements for entry into your preferred degree at Macquarie. UAC will generate a selection rank based on
        these results, which Macquarie will use to assess your application. Please keep in mind that the higher your
        previous tertiary marks are, the more competitive your application is likely to be. More information about
        transferring to Macquarie can be found <a href="https://page.mq.edu.au/transfer-to-macquarie.html"
            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The selection rank for the {course_name} is {selection_rank}. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>{key_dates}</p>
    <p>Once you have received and accepted an offer, you can apply for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) to be
        assessed for credit for your previous studies. &nbsp;RPL is granted on a case by case basis by the university,
        so we cannot provide any specific information about your eligibility for RPL in the new degree at Macquarie. You
        may be eligible for specified credit for completed units equivalent to units offered at Macquarie University.
        &nbsp;Our <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/study/admissions-and-entry/rpl/credit-transfer" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">credit transfer register</a> provides a list of units that have previously been
        accepted for credit by the University. &nbsp;This is not an exhaustive list and units may still be accepted if
        they are not on the list. &nbsp;It may also be useful to compare the <a href="https://unitguides.mq.edu.au/"
            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unit guides</a> for each unit required of the new course with
        those of the units you are trying to get credit for, to assess how similar they are. You may also be eligible
        for unspecified credit toward the elective component and general requirements of a degree (where no specific
        equivalent Macquarie unit exists).</p>
    <p>We recommend that you apply for any RPL you think may be applicable, once you have accepted an offer to study at
        Macquarie University. More information about RPL at Macquarie University can be found <a
            href="https://www.mq.edu.au/study/admissions/recognition-of-prior-learning" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are concerned that you may not meet the entry requirements for your preferred degree, Macquarie offers a
        number of alternative entry pathways that you can find <a
