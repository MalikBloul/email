    <p><strong><u>Recognition of Prior Learning</u></strong></p>
    <p>Once you receive and accept an offer to study at Macquarie University, you may be able to receive credit for
        units you have previously studied through&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.mq.edu.au/study/admissions/recognition-of-prior-learning" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)</a>. &nbsp;RPL is granted on a case by case
        basis by the university, so we cannot provide any specific information about your eligibility for credit in the
        new degree at Macquarie.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Students may be eligible for&nbsp;specified credit&nbsp;for completed units equivalent to units offered at
        Macquarie University. &nbsp;Our credit transfer register provides a list of units that have previously been
        accepted for credit by the University. &nbsp;This is not an exhaustive list and units may still be accepted if
        they are not on the list. &nbsp;You can find the Macquarie credit transfer register&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.mq.edu.au/study/admissions/recognition-of-prior-learning/credit-transfer-register"
            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a> Students may also be eligible for&nbsp;unspecified
        credit&nbsp;toward the elective component and general requirements of a degree (where no specific equivalent
        Macquarie unit exists).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Further, students may be eligible for credit based on formal and/or informal or non-formal learning. Formal
        learning is part of a structured program that leads to the full or partial achievement of an officially
        accredited qualification undertaken at a tertiary institution (e.g. a university, TAFE, or private college).
        Informal Learning is gained through work, social, family, hobby, or leisure activities and experiences. Informal
        learning is not organised or externally structured in terms of objectives, time, or learning support. Non-formal
        learning takes place through a structure program of learning but does not lead to an officially accredited
        qualification. If you can demonstrate how your work experience and or nonformal education and training
        experiences meet the learning outcomes for the unit for which you are seeking credit, you may be able to receive
        credit for specific units, reducing your overall study duration.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We recommend that you apply for any RPL you think may be applicable, once you have accepted an offer to study at
        Macquarie University. You do not have to enrol in units until after you have received your RPL outcome,
        allowing you flexibility to decide whether to continue or not continue the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
